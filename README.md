# Google-Photos-Space-Finder

Description:

The "Google-Photos-Space-Finder" is a JavaScript tool designed to help users identify and locate photos in their Google Photos library that are taking up storage space. By automating the process, the tool iterates through the user's photo collection and checks for specific target strings, such as "詳細資料" (Details) and "This item doesn't take up storage in your Google Account," which are indicative of photos occupying storage space.

The script utilizes the Google Photos web interface, simulating user actions to navigate through the library and pause periodically to ensure the page updates correctly. When a photo is found that takes up storage space, the tool displays an alert notifying the user of the discovery.

The "Google-Photos-Space-Finder" project offers a convenient way to identify storage-consuming photos, allowing users to manage their photo library efficiently and reclaim valuable storage space. With easy customization of target strings, the tool can be adapted to various languages and versions of Google Photos, making it accessible to a broader user base.
